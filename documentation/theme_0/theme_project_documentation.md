* Documentation is fluid, and we expect some requirements and documentation may change. What exists here however, should 
be enough to get us to a point of delivering a minimally viable product for our customer.

## Test plan
For documentation, the only requirement is that we follow Agile and LEAN. In this regard, user acceptance, and the peer 
review of documentation is sufficient as a 'test' that we meet some standard of criteria.
