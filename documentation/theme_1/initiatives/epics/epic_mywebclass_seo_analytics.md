Dependencies: Completion or in Parallel with Epic [MyWebClass Site Creation](epic_mywebclass_site_creation.md)

Risks: Analytics can degrade the user experience if overly invasive or if it relies on bulky imports. We need to ensure 
analytics occur behind the scenes, and in such a way to be secondary to the primary goal of creating a site of a high 
quality user experience. Analytics addons should not introduce major latency or reduce application interaction 
performance.

Estimated Effort: 1/2 Sprint, where Sprints are 2 Week periods. (1 Week)
